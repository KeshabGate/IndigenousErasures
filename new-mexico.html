                <p>

The Pueblo Tribe in New Mexico has faced significant impacts from nuclear development, particularly through the activities of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and uranium mining. The Los Alamos laboratory's Electrical Power Capacity Upgrade Project in 2021, involving a transmission line through ancestral Pueblo Tewa land, disrupted cultural practices and ignored the sovereignty of Indigenous peoples, reflecting long-standing criticisms of the lab's environmental abuses and its role in nuclear proliferation. Additionally, uranium mining in the region, especially during the 1940s and 1950s, led to severe health impacts, including high rates of lung cancer among Navajo miners due to radon exposure in poorly ventilated mines. This health crisis prompted the Navajo tribe to declare a moratorium on uranium mining in 2005. The Church Rock uranium mill spill in 1979, the largest radioactive material release in U.S. history, and the subsequent efforts for cleanup further highlight the environmental and cultural ramifications of nuclear development in New Mexico, underscoring the broader themes of the Anthropocene and indigenous erasure.</p>

                <h2>"It Was That Indian"</h2>
                <p>Tourist magazines did a couple<br>
on him, photographed him in kodak color, <br>
and the Chamber of Commerce celebrated <br>
that Navajo man<br>
. . .<br>
The city fathers named<br>
a city park after him<br>
and some even wanted to put up a statue<br>
of Martinez but others said<br>
that was going too far for just an Indian <br>
even if he was the one who started that area <br>
into a boom.</p>


<p>Well, later on, <br>
when some folks began to complain<br>
about chemical poisons flowing into the streams <br>
from the processing mills, carwrecks on Highway 53, <br>
lack of housing in Grants, <br>
cave-ins at Section 33,<br>
non-union support, <br>
high cost of living, <br>
and uranium radiation causing cancer,<br>
they—the Chamber of Commerce—pointed out<br>
that it was Martinez, <br>
that Navajo Indian from over by Bluewater<br>
who discovered uranium,<br>
it says so in this here brochure, <br>
he found that green stone over by Haystack<br>
out behind his hogan <br>
it was that Indian who started that boom.

            <p>The poem "It Was That Indian" provides a poignant commentary on the intersection of indigenous erasure, nuclear development, and the Anthropocene, specifically in the context of the Navajo discovery of uranium. The poem opens with a description of a Navajo man celebrated by tourist magazines and the Chamber of Commerce, indicating a superficial recognition of his contribution to the area's economic boom. However, the line "that was going too far for just an Indian" reveals a deep-seated racial prejudice, highlighting the indigenous erasure prevalent in narratives surrounding nuclear development.</p>

<p>As the poem progresses, it lists various negative consequences of the uranium boom, such as chemical pollution, accidents, housing issues, and radiation-induced cancer. The Chamber of Commerce's deflection of blame onto the Navajo man, Martinez, for these problems is a rhetorical strategy that shifts responsibility from those who exploited the resource for profit to the indigenous person who discovered it. This shift represents a common theme in the Anthropocene, where indigenous peoples are often blamed for environmental issues they did not create and are disproportionately affected by.</p>

<p>The repeated reference to Martinez as "that Indian" dehumanizes him and reduces his identity to a racial stereotype. This reduction reflects the broader theme of indigenous erasure in the narrative of nuclear development and the Anthropocene. The poem critiques the way indigenous contributions are acknowledged only when convenient and blames them for the negative repercussions of industrialization and nuclear proliferation.</p>

<p>In the context of the bomb spike marking the start of the Anthropocene, the poem underscores the irony of blaming indigenous peoples for a nuclear legacy that primarily reflects Western industrial and military pursuits. The poem's narrative illustrates the complex layers of racial prejudice, exploitation, and environmental impact that characterize the Anthropocene, especially concerning nuclear history and indigenous communities.</p>
