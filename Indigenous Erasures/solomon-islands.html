                <h2>Background on the Solomon Islands</h2>
                <p>
The Solomon Islands, while not having signed or ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), has actively supported global efforts towards nuclear disarmament. The nation has consistently voted in favor of United Nations resolutions advocating for the TPNW since 2018, emphasizing the need for universal adherence to the treaty. The Solomon Islands was also involved in the TPNW negotiations at the United Nations in New York in 2017, voting alongside 122 states for its adoption. This participation underscores the Solomon Islands' commitment to the movement against nuclear weapons, as evidenced by their 2016 vote in favor of a resolution that initiated negotiations for a treaty aimed at the total elimination of nuclear weapons</p>            </div>

                <h2>"Nuclear Waste"</h2>
                <p>Before you dump it—think!<br>
You are one of us in the Pacific<br>
You are not on the moon<br>
As your flag signifies.<br>
Before you dump it—wait.<br>
Is not the sea your livelihood?<br>
Fishing around the Pacific<br>
Something we have in common.

            <p>"Nuclear Waste" is a powerful poem that succinctly captures the tensions and concerns surrounding nuclear waste disposal, particularly in the Pacific region, a crucial aspect of the Anthropocene and the nuclear age. The poem's opening lines, "Before you dump it—think! / You are one of us in the Pacific / You are not on the moon / As your flag signifies," immediately establish a tone of admonishment and solidarity. The reference to the moon and the flag (likely the U.S. flag) alludes to the Apollo missions, suggesting a critique of the Western, particularly American, approach to treating distant lands and seas as dumping grounds for hazardous waste, analogous to how space was viewed during the Space Race.</p>

<p>The poem's plea, "Before you dump it—wait. / Is not the sea your livelihood? / Fishing around the Pacific / Something we have in common," speaks to the shared reliance on and connection to the Pacific Ocean among its bordering communities. This stanza highlights the communal nature of environmental stewardship and the shared consequences of ecological neglect, particularly relevant in the context of the Anthropocene, an era defined by human-induced environmental changes.</p>

<p>The repeated phrase "Before you dump it" serves as a refrain, emphasizing the urgent need for consideration and caution in handling nuclear waste. This cautionary tone resonates with the broader themes of the Anthropocene, where human actions, particularly concerning nuclear technology, have profound and lasting impacts on the planet.</p>

<p>Overall, "Nuclear Waste" employs a direct and communal voice to critique the recklessness often associated with nuclear waste disposal. It underscores the shared responsibility and interconnectedness of Pacific nations in the face of environmental threats, a poignant reminder in an era where the consequences of human actions are inscribed indelibly on the Earth's geological record.
