        <h1>Indigenous Erasures in the Nuclear Anthropocene</h1>
        <h3>With Examples from Indigenous Poetry</h2>
        <p>Poetry is a minimized art form across the board in today’s society. In 2012, just 6.7% of Americans reported having read one poem in the past year (Ingraham 2015), and with the rise of short-form content and fast-paced social media, it’s hard to imagine this number increasing significantly in the coming decades. Indigenous narratives, especially regarding climate change, are also disproportionately diminished. As Cho (2019) eloquently explains, “Pacific Islanders have been frequently evoked as the quintessential climate refugees, yet they remain largely absent from the discussion of Asia and the Anthropocene,” illustrating the hypocrisy of an “Anthropocene” that primarily focuses on the Global North (p. 124). These two minimizations suggest an opportunity for reflection and a novel perspective.</p>
        <p>Tackling climate change, one of the most pressing issues facing the world today, requires strategies and ideas that are not often employed with other social issues. Science and policy are an important piece of the puzzle; However,  “The scientists have done their job—they’ve issued every possible warning, flashed every red light. Now it’s time for the rest of us… And the artists, whose role is to help us understand what things feel like” (McKibben, 2011, p. 13-14). Poetry, as a truly creative art form, offers a chance to reimagine our approach to the climate crisis and to incite audiences to take action due to the strong emotions they feel from the poetry.</p>
        <p>Finally, Indigenous poetry specifically is best suited to offer this reimagined perspective. Specifically, “Indigenous peoples have a unique capacity to resist despair through connection to collective memory. They might be our best hope to build a new world rooted in reciprocity and mutual respect” (Aguon, 2021). By putting minimized art created by marginalized groups in the spotlight, it may be possible to effect a radical shift in the mindset of the public vis-a-vis the climate change narrative. American society especially, with its monolithic Western mindset, could stand to gain significantly from exposure to these differing narratives.
